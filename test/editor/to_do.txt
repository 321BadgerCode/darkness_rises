To make a level editor in C++ using SFML, you can follow these steps:

	Set up your SFML project with the necessary dependencies and include statements for SFML.

	Create a window and a grid system for your level editor using SFML's RenderWindow and RectangleShape classes.

	Implement a way for the user to click on the grid system and add platforms, enemies, or the player using SFML's Mouse class and event handling system.

	Implement keyboard input using SFML's Keyboard class to allow the user to switch between different object types (platforms, enemies, player) and move around the grid system.

	Use a JSON library such as nlohmann/json to store the level data in a JSON file.

	When the user is done editing the level, save the JSON data to a file using the JSON library.

	Implement the game engine using SFML's game loop and event handling system.

	Load the JSON file containing the level data into the game engine.

	Use the level data to create the player, platforms, and enemies in the game engine.

	Implement collision detection using SFML's Rect and FloatRect classes to detect when the player collides with a platform or an enemy.

	Implement smooth jumping for the player using SFML's Keyboard class to handle input and SFML's Vector2f class to calculate the player's movement.

	Implement enemy movement using SFML's Clock class to keep track of time and SFML's Vector2f class to calculate the enemy's movement.
